# Project-GuessTheButton

Hello! This is my first project using Javascript/HTML/CSS and I am happy to make it public! The whole project is based on guessing the "lucky" button. First you will have to type a number as an input which will represent the number of buttons that you want to be created. (Be careful of how many buttons you want to create, because only one is the lucky one!) After the buttons are created and shown to the user, all you have to do is blow on your screen for good luck and press one of the buttons! The message regarding winning or losing will be displayed in an "alert" form.
